Smart Home Assistant Chatbot
This is a Smart Home Assistant Chatbot that allows users to control smart home devices through text-based commands. It is built using Python, Flask, and pyttsx3 (for text-to-speech functionality). The chatbot is designed to simulate the control of devices such as lights and thermostats.

Features
Control smart home devices: The chatbot can simulate turning devices like lights and thermostats on or off.
Web interface: A user-friendly front-end built with Flask for web-based interaction.
Text-to-speech feedback (optional): The chatbot can give feedback in the form of speech using the pyttsx3 library.
Simple Command Processing: Recognizes basic commands to control lights and thermostats.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Flask: Web framework for building the application.
pyttsx3: Text-to-speech library (optional feature).
HTML/CSS: For creating the web interface.
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x
Flask (Web framework)
pyttsx3 (Text-to-speech library)
Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask pyttsx3
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-home-assistant-chatbot.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd smart-home-assistant-chatbot
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install flask pyttsx3
Run the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the chatbot: Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to interact with the Smart Home Assistant.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can interact with the chatbot by entering commands like:

"Turn the light on"
"Turn the light off"
"Increase the thermostat"
"Decrease the thermostat"
The chatbot will respond with appropriate feedback.

Example Commands
Light control:

"Turn the light on"
"Turn the light off"
Thermostat control:

"Increase the thermostat"
"Decrease the thermostat"
Invalid commands:

"What is the weather?"
Response: "Sorry, I didnâ€™t understand that command."
If pyttsx3 is installed, the chatbot will also provide voice feedback.

Future Work
Integrate with real smart home devices (lights, thermostats, etc.).
Enhance NLP capabilities to better understand more complex commands.
Add voice recognition to improve user experience.
Add user profile management to personalize interactions.
Security features to protect device control.
